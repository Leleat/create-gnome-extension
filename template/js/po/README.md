# Translations

This directory contains files for the translation of your project. The template file (`main.pot`) lists all translatable strings. It can be updated with `/scripts/update-translations.js`. Translators will use the template to create translation files (`*.po`).

Visit [gjs.guide](https://gjs.guide/extensions/development/translations.html) for more information.
